Business Process Analyst Markos Stefanou from Viva Wallet [shared](https://aug.atlassian.com/events/details/atlassian-athens-presents-jira-training-and-workshop) his experience from being the administrator of a Jira instance with 1.5M issues.

Some questions triggered by the presentations were the following:

1. Which are the benefits of using Jira for a startup and for a big company?
2. Can we customize the columns of a Jira kanban and the filters that appear on the top?

At the workshop we had setup the latest Jira Software [publicly](http://167.99.136.248:8080) with an evaluation license, a Jira project and users with different roles in an imaginary high-tech restaurant :p The credentials of different roles were given to all and we saw in practice introductory features like an issue being edited by different persons and changing status. We even kept a [screencast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-q6IfzQScdk) of the setup.

At the second presentation on Jira administration we shared some more tips like:

1. If the resolution is not empty, it is striked through at the board.
2. At project admin pages, Roles have a permissions helper for troubleshooting

Our next event will be on the 12th of july.
