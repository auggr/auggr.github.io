On the 12 of july we had the opportunity to be at the [Athens Center For Entrepreneurship And Innovation](https://acein.aueb.gr) and discuss about:

1. Trello, an excellent talk about Kanban and Trello tools from Panos, Greek Yellow Pages
2. Jira Service Desk, a very interesting and eye-opener talk about the use of Jira Service Desk and the processes that you can follow, from Effie, Nimaworks
3. ScriptRunner for Jira, a lightning talk from Thanos, Apaptavist on how the ScriptRunner for Jira team used their addon to automate their Support Portal.
