On the 12 of july we had the opportunity to be at the [Athens Center For Entrepreneurship And Innovation](https://acein.aueb.gr) and discuss about:

1. Trello, an excellent talk about Kanban and Trello tools from Panos, Greek Yellow Pages
2. Jira Service Desk, a very interesting and eye-opener talk about the use of Jira Service Desk and the processes that you can follow, from Effie, Nimaworks
3. ScriptRunner for Jira, a lightning talk from Thanos, Apaptavist on how the ScriptRunner for Jira team used their addon to automate their Support Portal.

In case you couldn't be there, here is what you've missed:
