Every 1-2 months we meet in Athens to discuss about Atlassian products like Jira and Confluence.

We are a community of users of Atlassian products so in our events no Atlassian or other products or Commercial services are being sold. We share questions and best practices around tools, business cases and cases about agile practices using Atlassian products.

Usually our event is on a thursday at 18:30 GR with an introductory presentation, an advanced presentation, a short workshop and plenty of pizza and beers for networking.

You can find when is our next event and reserve a seat by doing an RSVP at [aug.gr](http://aug.gr) or at [meetup](https://www.meetup.com/athensaug)

If you are interested in presenting anything, you can email us at athens_greece at atlassianusergroup.com and we can assist in things like having a proper space, live streaming, screencasting and assistance from our sponsor Atlassian and from our local sponsor - the Atlassian partner [Nimaworks](http://www.nimaworks.com).

Until our next event you can join our [Slack](http://www.aug.gr/2ItvAlj) channel.
