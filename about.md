Every 1-2 months we meet in Athens to discuss about Atlassian products like Jira and Confluence.

We are a community of users of Atlassian products so in our events no Atlassian or other products or Commercial services are being sold. We discuss about tools, business cases and cases about agile practices using Atlassian products.

Usually our event is on a thursday at 18:30 GR with an introductory presentation, an advanced presentation, a short workshop and plenty of pizza and beers for networking.

You can find when is our next event and reserve a seat by doing an RSVP at [aug.gr](http://aug.gr) or at [meetup](https://www.meetup.com/athensaug)

Until our next event you can email us at athens_greece under atlassianusergroup.com or join our [Slack](http://www.aug.gr/2ItvAlj) channel to share questions and best practices around Atlassian products.
